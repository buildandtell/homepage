Build something and then tell others how you did it, that's where the name comes from. The utopian buildandtell community will be one where a bunch of learners come along things they built and tell other members how they did that, resulting in an interactive learning experience.

Since majority of learners are not building things already; so initially the community is about teaching learners how to build things through open source contributions, tech events and online and offline interactions. Also mentoring school childrens is one of the secondary goals.

We're open to suggestions and feedbacks.
